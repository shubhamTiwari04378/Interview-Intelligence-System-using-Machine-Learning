The dataset provides metrics to evaluate interview quality and potential biases by analyzing interaction dynamics between candidates and interviewers. It includes unique identifiers for each interview, candidate, and interviewer, along with profile types. Key interaction metrics encompass the Speak to Listen Ratios for both parties, Average Turn Time, Longest Monologue durations, and Silence Ratio, which reflect the conversational balance. Engagement and presence indicators like Late Joining Times, Noise Index, Speaking Pace, and Live Absence capture punctuality, sound quality, and participation consistency. Additionally, the dataset tracks Perceived Emotions (Positive or Negative) for both parties, Compliance Ratio to assess adherence to company interview guidelines, and interview structural components such as self-introductions and opportunities for candidate questions. The interview Status provides a final outcome indicator, enabling assessment of interview integrity and alignment with organizational standards.
